This README provides step-by-step instructions to create and run a Vite project for your GitHub repository.

Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed on your system:

Node.js: Version 12.2.0 or higher (node -v to check).

npm, Yarn, or PNPM: A package manager to install dependencies.

Steps to Create a Vite Project
1. Initialize a New Project
Run the following command in your terminal:

bash
npm create vite@latest <project-name>
Replace <project-name> with your desired project name. You will be prompted to:

Select a framework (e.g., React, Vue, Vanilla, etc.).

Choose a template (e.g., JavaScript or TypeScript).

Alternatively, use:

Yarn: yarn create vite <project-name>

PNPM: pnpm create vite <project-name>.

2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Move into the newly created project folder:

bash
cd <project-name>
3. Install Dependencies
Install all required packages listed in the package.json file:

bash
npm install
You can also use Yarn (yarn) or PNPM (pnpm install) if preferred.

4. Start the Development Server
Run the development server to preview your application:

bash
npm run dev
This will start the server and provide URLs for local and network access, such as:

Local: http://localhost:5173/

Network: http://<your-ip>:5173/.

To expose the app on all network interfaces, use:

bash
npm run dev -- --host
Building for Production
To create an optimized production build, run:

bash
npm run build
This generates bundled files in the dist folder, which can be deployed to a web server or hosting service like GitHub Pages or Netlify.

Project Structure Overview
Here are key files and folders in a Vite project:

index.html: Entry point of the application.

src/main.js or src/main.jsx: Main JavaScript file where your app starts.

src/App.js or src/App.jsx: Main component file (if using React).

vite.config.js: Configuration file for customizing build processes.

Notes
For production deployment, copy the contents of the dist folder to your hosting service.

Customize configurations in vite.config.js as needed for plugins or specific requirements.
